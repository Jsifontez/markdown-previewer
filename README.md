## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jsifontez/markdown-previewer/blob/main/public/markdown-previewer.png)

Hi :wave: this was a challenge to create a preview for markdown texts. However I wanted to add an extra functionalities. That was the hard of the project.

Thats extra functionalities were:

- Copy by click an icon
- Download into a file by clicking an icon
- Drag & Drop a file into a textarea

Was hard beacuse I had not knowledge about any of these. For that reason the main thing that I learned in this project was:

- The `clickboard` API
- How create a file usign `Blob` and `<a>`
- How to copy a file with `dataTransfer` and `file reader`
